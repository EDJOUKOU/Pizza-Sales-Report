Based on the sales performance data, here are a few recommendations to enhance business growth:

- Focus on Top-Selling Items: Since the Thai Chicken Pizza is the best-seller, consider offering promotions, combo deals, or highlighting it in marketing campaigns to further boost its sales.

- Expand the Classic Pizza Category: Given its popularity and high revenue, explore adding new varieties to the Classic Pizza menu, or offer limited-time flavors to attract more customers.

- Leverage Peak Sales Days: Since the first day of the month is the busiest for orders, consider launching special discounts or loyalty rewards to capitalize on this trend and incentivize repeat purchases.

- Optimize Staffing During Peak Hours: With peak times between 11 AM–12 PM and 5 PM–6 PM, ensure enough staff is available to handle the rush efficiently and maintain customer satisfaction.

- Target Marketing During Peak Hours: Implement time-specific promotions or special offers during the busiest hours to further increase sales and encourage customers to visit during those times.
